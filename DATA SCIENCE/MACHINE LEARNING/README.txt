Frequently Asked Questions
----------------------------

Q0: (Meta) How do I use AIDL FAQ?
Learning AI requires you to absorb large amount of information. So the first requirement for you is to be able to read carefully. AIDL FAQ is a guide in the form of Q&A to explain how you can learn AI or deep learning properly. The most important questions are Q2-4. They are answers on "how to learn deep learning?" The next important question is Q10, which is about what language you should learn in order to learn AI/DL properly. Many of these questions have links which themselves are filled with links. For example. Learning Deep Learning - Top Five Lists (http://thegrandjanitor.com/…/learning-deep-learning-my-top…/) is one of them.

Since the FAQ is mostly written by me (Arthur Chan) and I am limited in my knowledge. We also have a community-driven knowledge base called AIDL_KB (https://github.com/arthchan2003/AIDL_KB), you may submit suggested changes through git and curators will integrate your changes from time to time.

Q1: How do I start AI/ML/DL?
A: 
Step 1: Learn some Math and Programming,
Step 2: Take some beginner classes. e.g. Try out Ng's Machine Learning.
Step 3: Find some problem to play with. Kaggle has tons of such tasks.
Iterate the above 3 steps until you become bored. From time to time you can share what you learn.
Here's a post which one of us (Arthur) wrote up. It summarizes his experience in learning machine learning and you might find it useful. (http://thegrandjanitor.com/…/learning-machine-learning-som…/)

Q2: What is your recommended first class for ML?
A: Ng's Coursera, the CalTech edX class, the UW Coursera class is also pretty good.

Q3: What are your recommended classes for DL?
A: Go through at least 1 or 2 ML class, then go for Ng's deeplearning.ai class, Hinton's, Karparthay's, Socher's, LaRochelle's and de Freitas'. For deep reinforcement learning, go with Silver's and Schulmann's lectures. Also see Q4.

Q4: How do you compare different resources on machine learning/deep learning?
A: (Shameless self-promoting plug by Arthur) Here is an article, "Learning Deep Learning - Top-5 Resources" written by me (Arthur) on different resources and their prerequisites. I refer to it couple of times at AIDL, and you might find it useful: http://thegrandjanitor.com/…/learning-deep-learning-my-top…/. 
Other than my own list, here are some very good lists I recommend you to read through as well,
* YerevaNN Lab's "A Guide to Deep Learning" (http://yerevann.com/a-guide-to-deep-learning/) - concepts are ranked in terms of difficulty, very handy for learners. 
* A16Z AI playbook: http://aiplaybook.a16z.com/docs/reference/links - a list which placed more focus on AI, it complements the other lists I quote.
* Reddit's machine learning FAQ has another list of great resources as well.

Q5: How do I use machine learning technique X with language L?
A: Google is your friend. You might also see a lot of us referring you to Google from time to time. That's because your question is best to be solved by Google.

Q6: Explain concept Y. List 3 properties of concept Y. 
A: Google. Also we don't do your homework. If you couldn't Google the term though, it's fair to ask questions.

Q7: What is the most recommended resources on deep learning on computer vision?
A: cs231n. 2016 is the one I will recommend. Most other resources you will find are derivative in nature or have glaring problems.

Q8: What is the prerequisites of Machine Learning/Deep Learning?
A: Mostly Linear Algebra and Calculus I-III. In Linear Algebra, you should be good at eigenvectors and matrix operation. In Calculus, you should be quite comfortable with differentiation. You might also want to have a primer on matrix differentiation before you start because it's a topic which is seldom touched in an undergraduate curriculum.
Some people will also argue Topology as important and having a Physics and Biology background could help. But they are not crucial to start.

Q9: What are the cool research papers to read in Deep Learning?
A: Here are few good lists:
* https://github.com/flo…/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap 
* Another classic is deeplearning.net's reading list: http://deeplearning.net/reading-list/
* AIDL has a curated github as well, maintained by members: https://github.com/arthchan2003/AIDL_KB
* Awesome deep learning papers have the most cited papers: https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers

Q10: What is the best/most recommended language in Deep Learning/AI?
A: This is one of the most frequently asked questions and it re-emerged from time to time. So here are few couple of useful point of view:
In general, if you are working on computer, you will need to switch between languages from time to time. So arguing about language and which is better is not a wise thing. If we want to give the best advice, perhaps the answer is you should just learn as many of them as possible.
Of course, your time is limited. So AIDL usually recommend python as your first choice. Python is cited as a good language for AI/DL because it has the best support of libraries. Most ML libraries from python links with C/C++. So you get the best of both flexibility and speed.
Other also cites Java (deeplearning4j), Lua (Torch), Lisp, Golang, R. It really depends on your purpose. Practical concerns such as code integration, your familiarity with a language usually dictates your choice. R deserves special mention because it was widely used in some brother fields such as data science and it is gaining popularity.
Finally, there is Matlab/Octave, it is also useful to learn because many Coursera ML's class is Matlab-based. e.g. Ng's class and Hinton's class. Sure, you can finish them in python, but there are much re-implementation in the process.

Q11: I am bad at Math/Programming. Can I still learn A.I/D.L?
A: Mostly you can tag along, but at a certain point, if you don't understand the underlying Math, you won't be able to understand what you are doing. Same for programming, if you never implement one, or trace one yourself, you will never truly understand why an algorithm behave a certain way.
So what if you feel you are bad at Math? Don't beat yourself too much. Take Barbara Oakley's class on "Learning How to Learn", you will learn more about tough subjects such as Mathematics, Physics and Programming.

Q12: Would you explain more about AIDL's posting requirement?
A: This is a frustrating topic for many posters, albeit their good intention. I suggest you read through this blog post http://thegrandjanitor.com/2017/01/26/posting-on-aidl/ before you start any posting.

Q13: What is the list of common public database?
A: Take a look of the collection from our members: https://www.facebook.com/groups/DeepNetGroup/permalink/394240667635488/
Also this contributed link:
https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets

Q14: Can I found some freebooks on Machine Learning?
A: Many links you will see on-line are actually filled with non-free contents. Of course you also want to download books legally. Here is one which I think it's satisfactory:
https://www.kdnuggets.com/…/10-free-must-read-books-machine…
https://www.kdnuggets.com/20…/…/free-data-science-books.html
http://www.wzchen.com/data-science-books/
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
http://www.deeplearningbook.org/

Q15: What is the difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning?
A: Many people would lead you to believe it is a matter of opinion. But see if this link helps you?
http://thegrandjanitor.com/…/what-is-the-difference-betwee…/
At the end of the post, it also links with several articles on the same topic.

Q16: Wow! We often asked "How do I start at AI/deep learning/neural networks?" Can't we just filter out all these messages?
A: Nope. We are happy to spread knowledge of AI and deep learning to everyone in the world. Also be nice to beginners. Remember: 5 minutes before you learn something, you don't know something.
But well, what if someone does ask the "Start" question? Say this, 
"Please take a look of the Pinned Post FAQ Q2-Q4, you should have tons of ideas after reading them."

Q17: How do I join the satellite: AIDL-Literature Discussion ?

A: Hint: Rule 1 of AIDL-LD is "If you don't read, you won't survive here for long."

Q18: Why are you so rude (angry emoji) and close my "Thank you for acceptance" message?
A: To your "Thank you", first of all, we'd say "Welcome to AIDL!". Unfortunately, with our volume, it's rather hard to welcome every new member individually. That's why we usually just close the thread.

Q19: Hi everyone, I really want to build a chatbot? Can anyone tell me more?

A: This is frequently asked. But then we usually don't give detail answers. So first of all, despite what people tell you, machine doesn't really know how to respond like human yet. It is a difficult problem. We can only tell you some approaches to go forward.

The first approach is to write a bunch of ifs, and then each of them give users some answers. This result in programmer crafting a giant state machine like structure of the program. There are many abstraction framework which helps you to create this kind of program much faster, you can try AIML for example. AIDL seldom put focus on this kind of method, because it is mostly programming/lookup. And there is not much machine learning about it.

The second approach is gather a bunch of question/answer pairs, then try to train machine to learn it. You can use something like a neural network machine translation (NNMT) method or any translation models you like to train such a model. But then how do you come up with good and relevant answer is tough. So that's why it is still a research topic.

You can think the second approach could be extended to many other use cases of DL, e.g. you can stuff a reading comprehension program and later it can answer question. But then notice that you are still not solving the question of how to give natural and relevant dialogue.

Q20: Hi everyone, would you give me an idea for my AI project, FYP, thesis and competition?

A: Don't be lazy. Coming up with an idea is part of the training if you decide to do a project, FYP, or write a thesis, or join a competition. In fact, if you decide to join an AI competition, it will be cheating if we are the ones who come up with the idea.

But it's legit to ask *how you can come up with ideas*. Usually there are two ways: 
1, Go to check out other people's idea, then twist it. 
2, Go to solve a problem that you feel about. e.g. a lot of science project winners won because their love ones have diseases. And a deep learning-based approach help the process to diagnose the problem.

If you are out of ideas, then consider few things: 1) ask smarter people what inspire them to come up with an idea, 2) read a lot, 3) don't work on technical problem for a while and do some artsy stuffs. All 3 methods can give you a lot of inspirations.
